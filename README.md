### ⚡ Fun facts

My passion for IT started because I wanted to play video games, but I didn't have a PC. I started researching how to build PCs and all the information about which components are better, as well as the pros and cons of products X and Y. I compared all the components and changed my budget accordingly based on the new information. I love the whole process of reviewing information and trying to figure out the best fit for me.

I love reading fantasy sci-fi books.
