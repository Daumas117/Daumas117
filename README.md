### ⚡ Fun facts

My passion for IT started because I wanted to play video games. I used to watch others play the games that I wanted to play, but I didn't have a PC to run them. I started researching how to build a PCs and all the information about which components are better, as well as the pros and cons of products X and Y. I compared all the components and changed my budget accordingly based on the new information. I love the entire process of reviewing information and trying to figure out the best fit for me. Before I knew it, I was already learning how each component communicates with each other.

Interests:
  - Reading fantasy sci-fi books.
  - Videogames.
  - Sports: Futbol, Hockey, Crazy for NFL.
  - IT innovations.
