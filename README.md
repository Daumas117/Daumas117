### ⚡ Fun facts

My passion for IT started because i wanted to play videogames, but i didnt had one. I started researching how to build PC's and all the information regarding which component it's better, or the pros and cons of X or Y product. Comparing all the components and changing my budget accordingly to the new information. I Love all the process of reviewing information (data) and trying to figure it out the best fit for me. 

I love reading fantasy sci-fi books.
